# Software Development — Sedea Governance Center

This repository is a **Sedea Governance Center** for **Sedea-governed hosting repos**. It defines how agents and developers plan, implement, ship, and verify software under **Sedea Governance** — the rules, missions, and skills pinned from `.sedea/centers/software-development/` in hosting workspaces.

## Purpose

Govern end-to-end delivery from idea to production using a **depth-first iterative** approach: ship the **first PR** of an initiative before locking detail for later phases and PRs. Mission protocols, center rules, and skills live under `missions/`, `rules/`, and `docs/` — this README is orientation only.

## GitHub repository

|--------|-----|
| **Upstream (sedea-centers org)** | `git@github.com:sedea-centers/software-development.git` |
| **HTTPS** | `https://github.com/sedea-centers/software-development` |

Wave 2 retargeted the GitHub repo name to **`software-development`**. Wave 3 aligns **`centerSlug`** and hosting checkout paths with **`.sedea/centers/software-development/`**.

## Missions

| Command | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **`plan and deliver`** | Full PRD → plan tree → implementation and ship chain for multi-PR initiatives. |
| **`quick fix`** | Small, single-PR fixes with minimal planning overhead. |
| **`plan and deliver a single phase`** | Simplified Master Plan for bounded single-phase work (1–6 PRs, complexity ≤ 20). |
| **`debug and fix`** | Log-first diagnosis and targeted fixes; optional promotion into broader delivery. |
